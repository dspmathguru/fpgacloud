# fpgacloud
Tools to work in the cloud with FPGAs.  AWS F1 instances are the first target as
they are the only cloud FPGA's I have tried using to date.

# Goal
Make a FPGA development framework for FPGA acceleration in the cloud.
Currently there is a lot of moving parts to this sort of development requiring
people to really understand a lot of different aspects of of cloud based FPGA
computing.

# Usage
Right now there is not much to this environment as it is in the middle of being
created.
